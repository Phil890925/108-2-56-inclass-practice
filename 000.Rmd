## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
a <- 2
a = 2 # = 與 <-同義
```
```{r}
3 -> b
```
```{r}
num1<-5 # 非整數
num2<-5L # 整數

num1Vector<-c(5,6,7)
num2Vector<-c(5L,6L,7L)
```
```{r}
char1<-"你好"
char2<-'你好'
```
